# Translation Notes

Notes on the English translation of *Конспект історії України* (An Outline of Ukrainian History) by Mykhaylo Braychevsky (1993).

## General Approach

The translation aims to preserve Braychevsky's scholarly voice and rhetorical style while producing readable English. The original Ukrainian text was OCR'd from BMP scans and contained significant artifacts that were corrected before translation. Where the original is rhetorically elaborate (e.g., the Preface's critique of Soviet historiography), the translation maintains that register.

## Transliteration Standard

Ukrainian proper nouns follow the **KMU 2010** (Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, 2010) romanization standard, except where a well-established English form exists:

- **Well-established forms used**: Kyiv, Herodotus, Scythians, Sarmatians, Huns, Avars, Goths, Trajan, Thracians, Cimmerians, Transcarpathia, Volhynia, Crimea
- **KMU 2010 applied**: Hrushevsky, Antonovych, Kostomarov, Braychevsky, Nadchornomorshchyna, Naddniprianshchyna
- **Archaeological cultures**: follow the most common English-language academic usage (Trypillia, Chernyakhiv, Zarubyntsi, etc.)

See `glossary.md` for the full terminology table.

## OCR Reconstruction: Uncertain Passages

The source BMP scans produced systematic OCR artifacts: clipped left margins (losing initial 1-3 characters of words), garbled Cyrillic-to-Latin Roman numeral confusion, and character substitutions. Most corrections were unambiguous from context. The following passages required significant reconstruction and carry higher uncertainty:

### Lines 202-204 (Chapter II: ethnogenesis passage)

**Severity**: High. Multiple consecutive sentences severely garbled.

The passage discusses the relationship between glottogenesis (origin of languages) and ethnogenesis (origin of peoples), and uses the example of the French people having Roman linguistic ancestors but Celtic/Germanic ethnic ancestors. The OCR had reduced many words to fragments (e.g., `нан нацню цесу` → `ототожнення процесу`, `зкавннн: ювними` → `спільностей. Так, мовними`). The reconstruction follows the argument's logic and Braychevsky's known positions on this topic.

The garbled `в плн цк а` in line 204, appearing in a list of Bronze Age cultures alongside Trypillia, Yamnaya, and Lusatian, was reconstructed as `катакомбна` (Catacomb culture) — the most historically plausible candidate, though the OCR damage makes positive identification impossible.

### Lines 312-316 (Chapter IV: Antes Balkan campaigns)

**Severity**: High. Three consecutive lines severely corrupted.

These lines describe the Antes/Slavic military campaigns against Byzantium in the 6th century, the two stages of Balkan colonization, and Byzantium's pragmatic acceptance of Slavic settlement. The reconstruction follows the standard historiographic narrative of this period as presented in Hrushevsky and other sources Braychevsky would have drawn upon.

### Line 183 (Chapter II: end of metallurgy paragraph)

**Severity**: Moderate. The sentence ending was garbled beyond character-level recovery.

`Лише заліза метал остат різновид сировини. но ЗЛЕЄРОУЄ вав Основний` was reconstructed as: "Лише залізо остаточно подолало камінь як основний різновид сировини." ("Only iron definitively overcame stone as the primary type of raw material.") This follows the paragraph's argument about the gradual displacement of stone tools by metal.

### Line 243 (Chapter III: Scythian art)

**Severity**: Moderate. Sentence opening garbled.

`енанно саме нах ладевня місцевих` was reconstructed as `Поєднання місцевих` ("The combination of local [traditions]"). The context — a discussion of Scythian-Greek artistic synthesis — makes the meaning clear, though the original wording is unrecoverable.

## Translation Choices

### "Конспект" → "Outline"

The title word *конспект* literally means "synopsis/summary/outline." "An Outline of Ukrainian History" was chosen over alternatives like "A Synopsis" or "A Conspectus" as the most natural English equivalent for a scholarly overview.

### *Veche* and *druzhyna*

These terms are kept transliterated (in italics) rather than translated, as they are established loanwords in English-language medieval Slavic studies. Brief glosses are provided on first occurrence.

### "Підсоння" → "climate"

Ukrainian *підсоння* (literally "under-sun") is a somewhat archaic/literary term for climate. Translated straightforwardly as "climate."

### "Стоп" → "alloy" / "blend"

Braychevsky uses the metallurgical term *стоп* (alloy) metaphorically to describe ethnic and cultural blending. Translated as "alloy" or "blend" depending on context.

### "Варварство" → "barbarism"

Following Morgan/Engels terminology that Braychevsky explicitly references, *варварство* is translated as "barbarism" (the technical anthropological stage), not the pejorative "barbarism" of common English.

### Soviet-era terminology

Braychevsky's Preface is a sustained critique of Soviet historiographic dogma. Terms like *первіснообщинний лад* ("primitive communal system"), *рабовласництво* ("slave-owning system"), and *суспільно-економічна формація* ("socio-economic formation") are translated using the standard English equivalents from Marxist historiography, as these are the terms being critiqued.

## Remaining OCR Artifacts

A small number of minor OCR artifacts may persist in the corrected Ukrainian text, particularly:
- Occasional missing or extra spaces
- Stray punctuation marks
- Minor apostrophe issues in Ukrainian words with `'` (soft sign/apostrophe)

These do not materially affect the translation.
